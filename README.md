# Data Structures and Algorithms – Java

This repository contains my **Java-based Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and **interview practice programs**.  
It is primarily used for **learning, revision, and interview preparation**.

---

## Purpose of This Repository
- Practice core **Java programming concepts**
- Strengthen **DSA fundamentals**
- Prepare for **technical interviews**
- Maintain a personal reference of commonly asked problems

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Java**
- Java Collections Framework
- Java 8 Stream API
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📂 Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Numbers
- Collections
- Java 8 Streams
- Searching & Sorting
- Interview-based coding problems

---

## 🧪 Notes
- Many methods are **standalone utility methods**
- Some methods may **not be invoked in `main()`**
- Code is intentionally kept **simple and readable**
- Warnings for unused methods/variables are expected in practice code

---

## 📈 Example Problems
- Reverse a number / string
- Count digits in a number
- Second largest element in an array
- Longest substring without repeating characters
- Frequency of characters in a string
- Merge two unsorted arrays
- Even or odd number checks
- Sum and average of array elements

---
